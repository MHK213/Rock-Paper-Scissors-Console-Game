# ðŸª¨ Rock-Paper-Scissors Console Game

A console-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using C++.  
This project was developed as part of my **Level 02 problem-solving practice**, focusing on improving my understanding of control structures, functions, structs, enums, and reusability in C++.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Multiple rounds gameplay (up to 10 rounds)
- User vs Computer logic
- Color-coded results for wins, losses, and draws
- Randomized computer choice using seeded RNG
- Final game summary screen
- Clean modular function-based design
- Covers multiple fundamental concepts in one interactive program.
- Combines problem-solving skills like input validation, decision-making, and loops.
- Mimics a real-world application (simple AI, structured game flow, user interaction).
- Encourages extensions (you can add timers, leaderboards, multiplayer mode).
